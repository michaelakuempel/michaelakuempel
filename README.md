- 👋 Hi, I’m @michaelakuempel, I'm a researcher in cognitive robotics, and knowledge engineering
- 👀 I’m interested in Knowledge Representation and Web Knowledge Acquisition for creation of Knowledge Graphs. 
- 👀 I’m also interested in making knowledge actionable for applications on robots, but also in Augmented Reality applications for HoloLens, Smartphone and Google glass.
- 🌱 I’m currently investigating how to integrate LLMs in the knowledge engineering process, or in human robot interaction.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the topic of Actionable Knowledge Graphs or any of the mentioned topics!
